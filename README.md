## What is VIBE
  
It is a space where I write, reflect, and share learnings, mostly around security and technology. The site is built with **Hugo** and deployed through **GitHub Pages**.

## Feature Highlights

- Static site built with **Hugo**  
- Clean, minimal theme and layout  
- Posts, tags, RSS feed  
- Deployed via GitHub Pages  
- Disclaimer: All content here is for learning. Not a how-to for attacks, and not legal advice.

## Development

If you wish to run it locally, run `hugo server`. The site will be available at [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313).
