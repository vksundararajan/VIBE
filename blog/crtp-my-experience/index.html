<meta name=title content="CRTP: My Experience"><meta name=description content="Hey everyone,
I’m really happy to share that I’ve cleared the CRTP (Certified Red Team Professional) exam on my first attempt! This was a whole new area for me—no prior Active Directory (AD) pentesting experience, and still, I managed to get through it. So if you’re someone wondering whether this cert is possible without an AD background—yes, it is. Let me walk you through how I did it.

My Background Before CRTP
Before jumping into CRTP, my only real exposure to pentesting was TryHackMe rooms and clearing the eJPT exam. To be honest, I had never done any complete AD-based CTFs before. CRTP was the first time I was diving into the world of Windows domains and enterprise-style networks."><meta name=keywords content="cert,"><meta property="og:url" content="https://vksundararajan.github.io/buffor.lol/blog/crtp-my-experience/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Buffor // Blog"><meta property="og:title" content="CRTP: My Experience"><meta property="og:description" content="Hey everyone,

To be honest, I had never done any complete AD-based CTFs before. CRTP was the first time I was diving into the world of Windows domains and enterprise-style networks.</p><h2 id=preparation-strategy>Preparation Strategy</h2><p>The course content by <strong>Altered Security</strong> is actually very well-structured and crystal clear. Here&rsquo;s how I approached it.</p><p>I listened to the entire course once without taking any notes—just to absorb the flow. Then, I went back, watched it again, and took detailed notes. After that, I tried to solve everything using only my notes, occasionally referring back to the videos for confirmation. I repeated this pattern whenever I got time—no labs outside this, no extra CTFs—just the course and my notes.</p><p>One thing I genuinely wished for during the learning process is that <strong>Altered Security could have included hands-on video course with Sliver C2</strong>. Sliver is a modern and powerful red team command-and-control framework that’s becoming a solid alternative to Cobalt Strike. It would’ve been really useful to see how it integrates into AD attacks or post-exploitation workflows alongside the traditional tools used in the course. Hopefully, they’ll consider adding it in future course updates.</p><p>That’s all I did before scheduling the exam.</p><h3 id=exam-experience>Exam Experience</h3><p>I started my exam on Friday evening at 6 PM and finished it by Saturday morning 10 AM. Yes, I went the full 16 hours straight without a break. I’m someone who works better during the night, so that time window suited me best.</p><p>Now, about the difficulty—it was harder than I expected. Even with good preparation, I had to think a lot, test ideas, and keep pushing through.</p><p>I got privilege escalation on the first machine within 3 minutes. That gave me a confidence boost. But after that, it took me around 3 hours to find the next escalation path. From there, it was a mix of solving parts step-by-step, some fast, some slow, but overall manageable with persistence.</p><h3 id=reporting-and-certification-timeline>Reporting and Certification Timeline</h3><p>After completing the hands-on part, I spent the next day preparing and submitting my final report within 24 hours. I submitted the report on time and received my results on the 8th day, including weekends.</p><p>And the very next day after the results, I got my official CRTP certificate.</p><h3 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h3><p>This certification definitely pushes your thinking. It’s not just about running tools—it’s about chaining concepts together, understanding Windows internals, and documenting everything cleanly.</p><p>You can view my CRTP certificate here: <span class=tags><a target=_blank href=https://www.credential.net/10ca361d-d4e2-4cd8-b689-1109c711744c#acc.knrRh4ct>CRTP Certification</a></p><p>To anyone considering CRTP, I’ll say this: <strong>You don’t need to be an expert. You just need to be consistent</strong>. Watch the course, take notes, practice within the lab, and go for it when you’re ready.</p><hr><p>I hope my experience helps you gain some clarity if you&rsquo;re on the fence.
