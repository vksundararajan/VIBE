I’m super excited to share that I’ve passed the eJPT exam with a score of 94% in my first attempt. I managed to finish it in 6 hours, and I’ve got some handy tips and personal insights that might help those of you gearing up for the same challenge.

A Little Bit About Me
Before jumping into the specifics, let me give you a bit of background. I’ve been a software developer for three years, but I had zero experience in penetration testing before this. However, I decided to give it a shot and prepped for about two months. This goes to show that anyone can master this with the right focus and dedication."><meta name=keywords content="cert,"><meta property="og:url" content="https://vksundararajan.github.io/buffor.lol/blog/ejpt-my-experience/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Buffor // Books"><meta property="og:title" content="eJPT: My Experience"><meta property="og:description" content="Hey everyone,

I’ve been a <strong>software developer</strong> for three years, but I had zero experience in penetration testing before this. However, I decided to give it a shot and prepped for about two months. This goes to show that anyone can master this with the right focus and dedication.</p><h3 id=my-approach-to-the-exam>My Approach to the Exam</h3><p>Here’s something interesting — I didn’t follow the typical advice of jotting down detailed notes during the exam. Instead, I saved all the crucial info right on the target machines. This tactic helped me stay focused and keep a steady pace throughout the test.</p><p>If you think you can complete the task quickly, there’s no need to save notes externally. However, never stop the machine during the process. If you do, it’s over — you’ll lose everything.</p><p>Someone on LinkedIn told me that if I could solve all the easy challenges on TryHackMe, I would pass the exam. So, I focused on completing every easy CTF on TryHackMe before taking the exam. But that turned out to be unnecessary.</p><p>Even if you feel less confident, <mark>remember you have one more attempt</mark>. Don’t stress too much — just dive in and get through it quickly.</p><h2 id=working-through-the-exam>Working Through the Exam</h2><p>The exam had <strong>six machines</strong> ready to be tackled. After compromising four of them, I was able to answer all the questions I was asked.</p><p><strong>My advice?</strong> Read each question carefully to make sure you really understand what’s being asked, and then go for it.</p><h3 id=tips-for-smoother-testing>Tips for Smoother Testing</h3><ul><li><p><mark>Keep Bruteforce Simple</mark> Don’t waste time running large wordlists. Often, <u>clues in the questions help narrow down the passwords</u>. When you’re given four options in the question and asked to choose the correct password, simply copy those four options into a text file and run a brute-force attack. This can save a lot of time.</p></li><li><p><mark>Be Careful with Flags</mark> When dealing with flag.txt questions, <u>double-check the PATH to ensure you’re retrieving the flag from the correct location before submitting</u>. You won’t be able to change your answer later. The flag’s path will be specified in the question, so make sure to extract the flag only from that exact path.</p></li><li><p><mark>Don’t Overthink the Pivot Machines</mark> I didn’t need to do much with the pivot machine. A basic TCP scan was enough to get the job done, so don’t stress over it. I was simply asked which vulnerable service was running on the target machine. When I ran a TCP port scan in Metasploit, it revealed only one service. I submitted that and completed the task — no need for port forwarding or any extra steps.</p></li></ul><p><strong>NOTE</strong> The pivot process might get a bit tricky, but I didn’t worry about it since there were no questions requiring information from inside the pivot machine. I didn’t even try to compromise it. However, after completing the exam, I found out that marks were deducted because I didn’t demonstrate the pivoting. If I had known this earlier, I would have done the pivoting process. Since no questions directly asked for it, I assumed skipping it was fine.</p><h3 id=privilege-escalation-made-easy>Privilege Escalation Made Easy</h3><p>Getting higher privileges didn’t require anything too tricky. I got direct access to NT authority on two machines, cracked the Administrator password via SMB bruteforce on another, and exploited SUID on the last one. Look for the straightforward solutions; they’re there.</p><h2 id=reflections-on-the-exam-difficulty>Reflections on the Exam Difficulty</h2><p>Honestly, I thought the exam would be tougher. It turned out to be <strong>easier than the labs in INE</strong>. So, my final piece of advice? Prepare well, but don’t psych yourself out thinking it’s going to be super hard.</p><h3 id=a-word-to-future-test-takers>A Word to Future Test-Takers</h3><p>Just dive into the material, practice a lot, and don’t sweat it too much. The eJPT is totally doable if you approach it with a calm and collected mindset.</p><p>Best of luck to all of you!
