title: About Me
---
A precise log of what’s broken, bypassed, and built.

A personal space to write, reflect, and build clarity — no noise, no filters. Just raw thoughts, and everything that matters to me, in one place.

— Built for clarity. Written for no one but myself.

### **Whoami**

Name’s ~Vigneshwar. Just an ordinary guy who enjoys exploring how things work under the hood, especially when it comes to breaking and securing systems. Nothing extraordinary. Not an expert. I’m the kind of person who enjoys testing things out, messing with tools, and learning by doing. Most of what I know comes from trying, failing, and trying again.

I come from a **software development** background, and over time, I started leaning more towards security. I’ve since completed my Master’s in Cybersecurity and Privacy, and have been progressively deepening my focus in the field — exploring web security, participating in CTFs, diving into Active Directory labs, and building or customizing tools along the way.

I’m not trying to go viral or be known for anything. This is more like a personal changelog — something I can look back on, or maybe something others can learn from if they’re walking a similar path.

Everything here is simple, honest, and written mostly for myself. No fluff. No filters. Just raw logs from someone figuring things out...

### **Disclaimer**

Nothing here is meant to be a guide for real-world attacks, and definitely not for anything illegal. This site isn’t about showing off or claiming to know it all. Most of this is me figuring things out as I go. **Things might be wrong, incomplete, or outdated**. That’s part of learning.

Everything shared here is for learning purposes only. If you’re using any of this knowledge, make sure you’re doing it responsibly and ethically. I’m not here to tell you what to do — and I’m definitely not responsible if someone misuses what’s written here.

This is just my personal log. Keep it clean, keep it legal..
