&lt;p>A personal space to write, reflect, and build clarity — no noise, no filters. Just raw thoughts, and everything that matters to me, in one place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>— Built for clarity. Written for no one but myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="whoami">&lt;strong>Whoami&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Name’s ~Vigneshwar. Just an ordinary guy who enjoys exploring how things work under the hood, especially when it comes to breaking and securing systems. Nothing extraordinary. Not an expert. I’m the kind of person who enjoys testing things out, messing with tools, and learning by doing. Most of what I know comes from trying, failing, and trying again.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
